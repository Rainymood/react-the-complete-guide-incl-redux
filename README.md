# Notes to React the Complete Guide

These are my personal notes accompanying the course [React - The complete guide (incl Hooks, React Router, Redux)](https://www.udemy.com/course/react-the-complete-guide-incl-redux/learn/lecture/8090862#notes) from Udemy.

The goal of this repo is do illustrate several concepts of React (not everything covered during the course) and to provide working code examples with it. 

Therefore, each of these lessons will start with a certain `git checkout <sha1>` which will take you back to the revision which illustrates a certain key concept. Each "lesson" should be individually runnable with `npm start`. 

* [1. Creating your react app](doc/001-create-react-app.md)
* [2. Components](doc/002-components.md)
* [3. Dynamic content](doc/003-dynamic-content.md)
